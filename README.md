# AI-Based Project Matching for Consulting Firms

## Business Case

### Idea
Our business idea is to develop an AI-powered matching system that assigns consultants from consulting firms to client projects. The goal is to minimize opportunity costs and reduce employee turnover.

### Problem We Solve
We address the issue of over- and under-staffing by aligning workloads with consultants' skills and preferences. Furthermore, our solution enhances employee satisfaction by considering career development opportunities during the matching process.

### Target Customers
Our primary customers are IT consulting firms with 50 or more consultants, ranging from small to large organizations.

### Revenue Model
We generate revenue through:
- A one-time setup fee: **5.000€**
- Annual license fees based on the number of consultants: **200€ per consultant**
- Optional support packages: **10% of license fee**

### Differentiation
Unlike competitors, our approach is human-centric. We focus on enhancing rather than replacing staffing roles. Our solution uniquely emphasizes the development and satisfaction of consultants, which is currently an underserved area in the market.
