# Business Case: AI-Powered Matching for Consulting Firms

## Business Idea
Our solution provides an AI-powered matching system that helps IT consulting firms efficiently and accurately assign internal consultants to client projects. The goal is to reduce opportunity costs from underutilized capacity while also minimizing employee turnover.

## Problem Statement
Many consulting firms struggle with inefficient resource allocation, resulting in over- or understaffing. At the same time, individual skillsets and development goals of consultants are often overlooked. This not only affects project performance but also reduces employee satisfaction and retention.

## Solution
Our platform analyzes projects, skillsets, availability, and personal development goals to ensure optimal staffing. Data-driven decisions lead to better workload distribution and higher consultant satisfaction.

## Target Audience
IT consulting firms with at least 50 consultants that value efficiency, employee retention, and high-quality project staffing.

## Business Model
- One-time setup fee  
- Annual license fees (scaled by the number of consultants)  
- Optional support and service packages

## Competitive Advantage
Unlike purely operational tools, we follow a human-centric approach: we don’t replace staffing roles, but enhance them through data-driven intelligence. Our focus is not only on project staffing but also on the personal growth and development of consultants – a currently underserved area in the market.
